<h1>EclEmma Change Log</h1>

<h2>Trunk Build (not yet released)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The EclEmma project has been moved to
      <a href="https://github.com/jacoco/eclemma">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>Upgrade to JaCoCo 0.6.0.</li>
  <li>Correct menu labels in the <i>Coverage</i> view.</li>
  <li>SF #1968604: The <i>Coverage</i> view shows graphical bar charts instead
      of icons to visualize code coverage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.1.4 (2012/08/01)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upgrade to JaCoCo 0.5.9.</li>
  <li>SF #3549343: Correct source folder naming for HTML reports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.1.3 (2012/07/12)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upgrade to JaCoCo 0.5.8.</li>
  <li>Eclipse Bugzilla #383367: Fix drop-down menus in coverage view for Eclipse
      4.2.</li>
  <li>Trac #158: Lifecycle mapping for JaCoCo Maven goals when M2E is used.</li>
  <li>Trac #203: EclEmma feature now depends on Eclipse 3.5 or greater to
      ensure version check at installation time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.1.2 (2012/05/09)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Support for Eclipse 3.8 (Juno) since Eclipse 
      <a href="http://bugs.eclipse.org/227877">issue 227877</a> has been
      resolved.</li>
  <li>SF #3522048: Upgrade to JaCoCo 0.5.7.</li>
  <li>SF #3510762: Support for Scala application launches. Contributed by
      Joachim Hofer.</li>
  <li>Default setting (enabled) fixed for automatically opening the
      <i>Coverage</i> view.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.1.1 (2012/04/09)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Trac #195: Don't exclude output folders based on their name. This caused
      empty coverage data results in certain setups. Many thanks to Dominik
      Stadler for analyzing this bug.</li>
  <li>Avoid restoring column widths to zero in the <i>Coverage</i> view.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.1.0 (2012/02/26)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>For long-running processes intermediate coverage data dumps can now be
      collected without terminating the application under test. This feature
      allows so called <i>differential code coverage</i>, a technique proposed
      by Kaitlin Duck Sherwood in her paper <i><a class="extern" href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/tr/2008/TR-2008-14">Reducing
      Code Navigation Effort with Differential Code Coverage</a></i>.</li>
  <li>Trac #168: New editor for JaCoCo execution data files.</li>
  <li>Trac #190: The <i>Coverage</i> view option <i>Hide Unused Types</i> has
      been generalized to <i>Hide Unused Elements</i>.</li>
  <li>SF #3489951: Don't process class files in team provider folders.</li>
  <li>SF #3487904: Avoid NPE in case of new and empty launch configurations.</li>
  <li>SF #3477725: Java agent must not be added multiple times to plug-in
      launch configurations.</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.1 (2011/12/28)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Include bundle <code>org.objectweb.asm</code> with the EclEmma feature as
      this bundle is not available in all Eclipse distributions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.0 (2011/12/18)</h2>
<p>
  The first version of EclEmma that is backed by JaCoCo instead of EMMA. This
  adds several enhancements and new features to EclEmma.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Branch Coverage: Branch coverage is shown on the property pages and can be
      selected in the <i>Coverage</i> view. For the source editors there is a
      new annotation that marks lines with branches. A new tooltip provides
      details about branches on a per-line basis.</li>
  <li>No class file instrumentation: With JaCoCo Java classes are instrumented
      in-memory only, which means modified class files will not be written to
      the file system anymore. Therefore the "in-place instrumentation" mode and
      its disadvantages are not required any more (no re-build required, JAR
      files can be analyzed). Programs do now launch immediately without delay
      due to instrumentation of all class files.</li>
  <li>Source folders can be selected separately even if their class file
      output location is the same.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.5.3 (2011/05/05)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SF #3297297: Fixed NullPointerException for class files compiled without
    line number attributes.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Version 1.5.2 (2011/04/15)</h2>

    <code>NO_COVERAGE_DATA_ERROR</code>.</li>
  <li>SF #2881882: Fixed typo with missed blocks NLS key.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.5.1 (2010/08/18)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To ensure integrity and avoid installation warnings distributed EclEmma
    plug-ins are now signed by Mountainminds GmbH &amp; Co. KG.</li>
  <li>Source highlighting for Groovy code in combination with the Groovy-Eclipse
    plug-in.</li>
  <li>SF #2934564: Launch configurations aren't modified any more by simply
    opening the "Coverage" tab in the launch dialog. Save warnings are now only
    given when the dialog has actually been modified.</li>
  <li>SF #3037143: Remove invalid header from patched emma.jar manifest.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 1.5.0 (2010/06/24)</h2>

  <li>SF #2495620: Coverage view can be opened from the "Show In" menu, contributed
    by anonymous.</li>
