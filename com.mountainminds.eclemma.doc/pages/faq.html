<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3><a name="usage01"></a>How can I remove the coverage coloring from the Java editors again?</h3>
<p>
  If you remove the coverage session, also the coverage coloring will disappear.
  For this, hit <i>Remove Session</i> or <i>Remove All Sessions</i> in the
  <i>Coverage</i> view's toolbar.
</p>

<h3><a name="usage02"></a>Why can't I select source folders separately for instrumentation?</h3>
<p>
  EMMA works on Java class files. If source folders have the same output
  location, only all or none of them can be selected for instrumentation. If you
  want to select them individually please specify a different output location
  for each source folder. This can be done in the <i>Java Build Path</i>
  settings in the project properties. Check <i>Allow output folders</i> on the
  <i>Source</i> tab and specify different output folders for your source folders
  (for example bin-src/, bin-test/ etc.).
</p>

<h3><a name="usage03"></a>How can I run {whateverapplication} with EclEmma?</h3>
<p>
  EclEmma is designed for Java programs launched within Eclipse. Java
  applications that run in a different environment may be analyzed with the
  <a class="extern" href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/">EMMA library</a>
  directly. There are different supported launch types, other plug-ins may
  define additional launch types which are not supported by EclEmma. Check user
  documentation for currently supported launch types.
</p>

<h3><a name="usage04"></a>Does EclEmma support automated Ant builds?</h3>
<p>
  EclEmma is a Eclipse integration of the EMMA code coverage tool. EMMA itself
  comes with a comprehensive set of Ant tasks and can be used in automated
  builds. See <a class="extern" href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/docs.html">EMMA
  documentation</a>  for details.
</p>

<h3><a name="usage05"></a>How do I change the source code highlighting?</h3>
<p>
  The source code highlighting can be changed in the Eclipse <i>Preference</i>
  dialog at <i>General &rarr; Appearance &rarr; Editors &rarr; Text Editors
  &rarr; Annotations</i>. You can modify the highlighting style and color or use
  the vertical rulers instead.
</p>

<h3><a name="usage06"></a>Why can't I uncheck in-place instrumentation in the launch dialog?</h3>
<p>
  Some launch types require in-place instrumentation as there is no other way
  to get the instrumented classes into the classpath. In this case the checkbox
  is disabled and can not be unchecked.
</p> 

<h3><a name="usage07"></a>Do I need source code to use EclEmma?</h3>
<p>
  No, you can also get coverage information for e.g. third-party JARs. Just
  make them part of your class path settings in Eclipse and select them on the
  <i>Coverage</i> tab in the coverage launch dialog. If the library was compiled
  with debug information, line coverage will be shown in the
  <i>Coverage</i> view. In case the source is properly attached to the library
  syntax highlighting will happen in the editors the same way as with you source
  code.
</p> 

<h3><a name="usage08"></a>Why is this line yellow?</h3>
<p>
  EclEmma annotates all lines which are partly covered in yellow. Partly covered
  means that not all of the basic blocks associated with this line have been
  executed during the coverage session. In some cases it is not obvious why the
  Java compiler creates multiple blocks for a particular line of source code.
  Please see <a class="extern" href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/faq.html#q.fractional.examples">EMMA's
  FAQ entry about partially covered lines</a> for details. 
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3><a name="trouble01"></a>I get the error message "No coverage data file has been written". Please help!</h3>
<p>
  This may have several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>No instrumented class has been loaded during the test run at all. Make
  sure that the classes in focus are selected for instrumentation in the
  coverage launch dialog.</li>
  <li>The Java process did not terminate properly, e.g. has been manually killed
  with the <i>Terminate</i> button. Make sure your program terminates on its
  own.</li>
  <li>Your project contains the emma.jar file file in its Java path or contains
  a emma.properties file. To make EclEmma work properly, your project must not
  contain any EMMA specific resources or settings.</li>
  <li>Your launch configuration defines EMMA specific system properties. Make
  sure no such definitions are made.</li>
  <li>There is a <code>emma.jar</code> file in your JDK's <code>lib/ext/</code>
  folder. Please remove this and restart Eclipse.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="trouble02"></a>Code with exceptions shows no coverage. Why?</h3>
<p>
  The underlying EMMA library works on so called <i>basic blocks</i>. A basic
  block is a sequence of instructions without any jumps or jump targets. A
  basic block is marked as executed when it reaches its last instruction. In
  case of exceptions a basic block is aborted somewhere in the middle and not
  marked as executed. See
  <a class="extern" href="http://emma.sourceforge.net/faq.html#q.blockcoverage">EMMA's FAQ</a>
  for details. 
</p>

<h3><a name="trouble03"></a>My application does not run with EclEmma!</h3>
<p>
  Does your application properly execute within Eclipse in normal <i>run</i>
  mode? Please verify! If not, your app will most likely not execute in
  <i>coverage</i> mode either. In this case first create a proper launch
  configuration in Eclipse; then execute in <i>coverage</i> mode.
</p>

<h3><a name="trouble04">My Eclipse workbench window has no toolbar button for coverage launches!</a></h3>
<p>
  Even if EclEmma is installed properly, it will show its action sets only in
  some predefined perspectives related to Java tasks. If you want to use the
  coverage toolbar in other perspectives like <i>Resource</i> select
  <i>Customize Perspective...</i> from the toolbar's context menu and check the
  <i>Coverage</i> option on the <i>Commands</i> tab.
</p>

<h3><a name="trouble05">Why are JUnit4 test cases with expected exceptions shown as not covered?</a></h3>
<p>
  JUnit4 test cases with expected exceptions are shown as not covered even though
  they were executed. The reason for this is that underlying coverage library EMMA
  only considers block as executed when they reach their last instruction. For
  successful test cases marked with <code>@Test{expected=...}</code> this is not
  the case. See also <a href="#trouble02">"Code with exceptions shows no coverage. Why?"</a>.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3><a name="install01">Does EclEmma work with IBM Rational products?</a></h3>
<p>
  Yes, it has been confirmed that EclEmma works with RAD 7.0. The IBM Rational
  6.0 products will <b>not</b> work with EclEmma, as they are based on Eclipse
  3.0, EclEmma requires at least Eclipse 3.1.
