<h2>Session Import and Export</h2>

<p>
  While EclEmma is primarily designed for test runs and analysis within the
  Eclipse workbench, it provides import and export functionality.
</p>

<h3>Session Import</h3>

<p>
  If your program is launched outside the Eclipse debugging environment, you
  might import JaCoCo execution data from these launches. This allows to study
  the coverage results directly in your source code. The <i>Coverage Session</i>
  import wizard can be activated form the <i>File &rarr; Import...</i> menu or
  from the <i>Coverage</i> view's context menu.
</p>

<p>
  The wizard dialog requires you to specify the source of the execution data on
  its first page. There are three possible sources:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local <code>*.exec</code> file location.</li>
  <li>Remote <code>*.exec</code> file URL.</li>
  <li>IP address and port of a
      <a href="http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/agent.html">JaCoCo agent</a>
      attached to a running process. You can also specify whether the execution
      data should be reset in the target VM when dumping the data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If you keep a reference to the original execution data source (check the
  corresponding import option) you can simply re-import the data as often as you
  want. For this use the <i>Refresh</i> option from the context menu of the
  <i>Coverage</i> view or simply hit the <code>F5</code> key.
</p>

<p>
  On the second page you can specify session name and the scope, which are the
  source folders and libraries that should be considered.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Warning:</b> Imported execution data must be based on the exact same
  class files that are also used within the Eclipse IDE. If the external launch
  was based on different class files (e.g. created with different compiler) no
  coverage will be shown.
</p>

<h3>Session Export</h3>

<p>
  The session export wizard allows to export coverage sessions in one of these
  formats:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>HTML:</b> A detailed and browseable report as a set of HTML
  files.</li>
  <li><b>Zipped HTML:</b> Same as above but zipped into a single file.</li>
  <li><b>XML:</b> Coverage data as a single, structured XML file.</li>
  <li><b>CSV:</b> Coverage data on class level granularity as comma-separated
  values.</li>
  <li><b>Execution data file:</b> Native JaCoCo execution data format.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The <i>Coverage Report</i> export wizard can be activated form the
  <i>File &rarr; Export...</i> menu or from the <i>Coverage</i> view's context
  menu. There must be at least one coverage session available to use the export
  wizard.
</p>

<p>
  Select one of the existing sessions and the export format.
